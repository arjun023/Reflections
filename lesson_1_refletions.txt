till now lesson now was :-

-Intro of why do we need version control
-To compare file in windows we use "FC" command

-And to run notepad directly with git bash :
alias notepad="/c/Program\ Files\ \(x86\)/Notepad++/notepad++.exe"

-How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
if often happens , that some unexpected output occurs for some modified code , here the previous version of code is required.
thus having history can save the chaos and grow an efficient programmer.



now i am adding some text preferably random just to check the functioning of :
git log :- gives entire commit history with commit id's.
git diff id1 id2 :-  id1 is the id of the 1st commit , simillary id2 for second.
